# LangChain Learning Journey

Welcome to my **LangChain Learning Journey** repository! 🎓🐍 
Here you’ll find my experiments, notes, and example projects as I explore the world of LangChain and build practical applications with large language models.
I'm a bun in the oven so please be kind!

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **`notebooks/`**  
  Jupyter notebooks documenting step-by-step explorations of core LangChain concepts (chains, agents, memory, custom prompts, etc.).
  I use VS-Code, it's in my TODO list to list all the extensions I've been using, but so far, you just need to install extensions for Jupyter Python 
- **`examples/`**  
  My idea is to create a series of Self-contained sample scripts and mini-projects demonstrating how to integrate LangChain with different LLMs, data sources, and tools.
- **`docs/`**  
  Markdown guides and cheat-sheets summarizing key patterns, best practices, and resources.
- **`requirements.txt`**  
  Pin-file for reproducible environment setup.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/langchain-learning-journey.git
   cd langchain-learning-journey
   

2. Create, activate environment and install dependencies

- With pip

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

- With Conda

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate langchain-learning
```

🗺️ Intentional Roadmap

- Fundamentals: Chains, prompt templates, document loaders

- Agents & Tools: Custom toolkits, agent orchestration

- Memory & State: Conversational memory, vector stores

- Integrations: Retrieval-augmented generation, databases, APIs

- Production: Packaging, scaling, deployment patterns
